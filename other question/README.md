## chat template

As we mentioned in Appendix A.3.2, `Previous jailbreak attempts typically used the fastchat package to manage context. However, the settings of the new models do not synchronize with the package in a timely manner. Therefore, in this paper, we set all the prompts for our experiments (including system prompts, etc.) using the templates provided by the model provider in the “tokenizer\_config.json” file, in conjunction with Hugging Face’s “apply\_chat\_template” function. For the baseline methods, we made corresponding adaptations to ensure that the templates remained consistent.`

Therefore, we have adapted the chat templates used by SIJ. It is particularly important to note that for the Llama2-7b-chat model, its default chat template does not include a system prompt. However, in some baseline methods, such as SafeDecoding, a system prompt is adapted like `You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false information.`, which is a key point to be aware of.

If you also need to adapt the fschat package, you can use the adaptation function we wrote. A simple example is as follows:

```python
from .fschat_transformer_adapter import adapter

def load_conversation_template(template_name):
    conv_template = adapter(template_name)
    return conv_template
```

## experiment result

As a reminder, the “prompt” field in our experimental results file contains **all the content to be inputted to the model, not just the user prompt.** If you want to directly reproduce the results, please do not apply any other chat template to it, or extract only the user prompt from it and then use the `tokenizer.apply_chat_template()` function.
